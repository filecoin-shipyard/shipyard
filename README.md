# Filecoin Shipyard
Welcome to the Filecoin Shipyard! Inspired by the active and bustling places where ships are built and repaired, this is a venue for the Filecoin community to pursue and collaborate on code libraries, tools, experiments, products, and more.

It serves as a companion to the [filecoin-project](https://github.com/filecoin-project) Github org.

### Where should my Filecoin ecosystem project live?

- [filecoin-project](https://github.com/filecoin-project): For specifications, node implementations, and other core work.
- [filecoin-shipyard](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard): For ecosystem projects in active usage, development, or maintenance. Includes [Filecoin Grant](https://filecoin.io/grants/) awardees. (Projects that are unmaintained or unused for a long time will be deprecated or archived.)

Individuals and organizations are welcome & encouraged to start projects in other respositories.

### Contributing
Each Filecoin shipyard project is expected to have a README (we suggest the [standard readme](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme) format), contributing guidelines, and be actively deployed or used. To propose a new Shipyard project, or discuss changing ownership, please create an [issue](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/shipyard/issues/new).
